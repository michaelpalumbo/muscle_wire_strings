use muscle wire as a a vibrational medium. like an instrument string. 
	- find a way to vibrate it 
		- we are thinking of using a transducer 	
		- could use a stepper motor to strike it. 

Build a box resonator out of wood, stretch the muscle wire within the box. 

will need to get some crimps, ideally the barrel shape so we can mount the wires in the box. 

anothe rprototype could be to use a guitar bridge (or something in the shape of a tunomatic and nut, and place the bridge and nut at a length optimal for a good lowest frequency)
